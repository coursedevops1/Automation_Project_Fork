## Course Assignment

### Script v0.1
Once the virtual machine (VM) is set up, the next steps encompasses writing a script to configure the Virtual Machine for hosting a web server and later automating some maintainance tasks. Let's take a look at each of these sub tasks one at a time. 

 

Hosting Web Server: The first step is to set up a web server on the EC2 instance for hosting a website. It is also important to ensure that the apache2 server is running and it restarts automatically in case the EC2 instance reboots.

 

Archiving Logs: Daily requests to web servers generate lots of access logs. These log files  serve as an  important tool for troubleshooting.  However, these logs can also result in the servers running out of disk space and can make them stop working. To avoid this, one of the best practices is to create a backup of these logs by compressing the logs directory and archiving it to the s3 bucket (Storage). 

 

All this becomes a weekly/daily activity. These tasks can take a long time if done manually again and again. You have been assigned to write an automation bash script named ‘automation. sh’ to automate all these workflows.

### 
Script v0.2
There are two significant areas of improvement in our previous script.
 
No bookkeeping of archived files 
Currently, there is no record of compressed logs file getting copied to s3 via AWS CLI. We don't have a history of how many compressed tar files are copied to s3, their names, and the time when the copy process ended.
 
Manual execution of the script
Presently, the script has to be manually executed by an engineer every time. It should, however, be automatically run at a regular interval of time by a cron job.
 
In this task you will essentially upgrade the existing automation.sh script such that script will create a record when the tar file is copied from the EC2 to s3. Also, the script itself will set a cron job that will run the script at a regular interval of time.
